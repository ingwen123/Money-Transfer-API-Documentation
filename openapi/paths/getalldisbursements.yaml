    Use this endpoint to get the list of transaction you've made. By default, the result will be paginated by 20. You can change the pagination, filter, and sort the result by changing the url parameter.

    Format of the url parameter:

    https://bigflip.id/api/v3/disbursement?pagination=pagination&page=page&sort=sort&attribute=value
  
  parameters:
    
    - in: query
      name: pagination
      description: The pagination of the result. Default value is 20
      schema:
        type: integer
      required: false

    - in: query
      name: page
      description: The page number of the result to be viewed.
      schema:
        type: integer
      required: false
    
    - in: query
      name: sort
      description: |
        Sort the result by the attribute. Use the attribute name (e.g sort=id) to sort in ascending order or dash+attribute name (e.g sort=-id) to sort in descending order.

        You can also filter the result by changing attribute with the attribute to be filtered and value with the filter value. You can filter more than one attribute by appending another attribute filter to the url. Attribute that can be filtered are:

        * id - exact comparison
        * amount - exact comparison
        * status - exact comparison
        * timestamp - “like” comparison
        * bank_code - “like” comparison
        * account_number - “like” comparison
        * recipient_name - “like” comparison
        * remark - “like” comparison
        * time_served - “like” comparison
        * created_from - “like” comparison
        * direction - exact comparison
